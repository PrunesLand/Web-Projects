# Welcome to PrunesLand's Repository!

This is an active repository used by PrunesLand to store all active projects. 

Currently there are three accessible folders created to store projects. Those folders are:

  ### 1. Finished.
     This is a folder to store all finished and deployed projects made.
  ### 2. Ongoing.
     This is a folder used to store all actively developing projects.
  ### 3. References.
     This folder stores all projects done from coding bootcamps and tutorials. Looking back on past projects when times are tough.
